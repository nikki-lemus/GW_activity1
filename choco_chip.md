## Classic chocolate chip cookies

### Ingredients:
- **2 ¼ cups (9.9oz) all-purpose flour**
- **1 tsp baking soda**
- **½ tsp salt**
- **1 cup (230g) unsalted butter**, softened to room temperature
- **¾ cup (5.3oz) granulated sugar**
- **¾ cup (150g) packed brown sugar** (light or dark)
- **1 tsp vanilla extract**
- **2 large eggs**
- **2 cups (12oz) semisweet chocolate chips**
- **1 cup (125g) chopped nuts** (optional, like walnuts or pecans)

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven** to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This prevents the cookies from sticking.

2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugars:** In a large bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together on medium speed until smooth and creamy (about 2-3 minutes).

4. **Add eggs and vanilla:** Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then add the vanilla extract. Continue mixing until fully incorporated.

5. **Combine wet and dry ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed. Be careful not to overmix—just blend until the flour mixture disappears.

6. **Add chocolate chips:** Stir in the chocolate chips (and nuts, if using) by hand using a spatula or wooden spoon.

7. **Shape the dough:** Scoop about 1 to 2 tablespoons of dough per cookie, rolling it into a ball, and place it onto the prepared baking sheet. Leave some space (about 2 inches) between each ball of dough, as the cookies will spread while baking.

8. **Bake:** Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may look soft, but they'll firm up as the cookies cool.

9. **Cool the cookies:** Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Tips for success:
- If you want extra chewy cookies, underbake them slightly (bake for about 9 minutes), and let them cool on the baking sheet.
- For crispier cookies, bake for an additional 1-2 minutes.
- You can chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking to enhance the flavor and texture of the cookies.
